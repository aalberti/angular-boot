* Run gradlew run
* Connect to http://127.0.0.1:8080

## TODO

* SQLLite connection pool
* Prepared statements
* Jump to top of the page on selection? Find a better approach than side menu?
* Show number of hidden rows
* Configure DB & table name
* Count, limit, and return rows in one shot. Or at least make counting way quicker
* Now that the count query is slow, add "Loading..." during query
